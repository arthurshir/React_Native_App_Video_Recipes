Todos (Recipe Scraper)
-----------------------------

So looks like I'll have to do various Algorithms:
	- Website (Organization Specific) Recipe Scraper
	- Facebook Comments Recipe Scraper
	- Facebook Description Recipe Scraper

For Later:
	- Something I could try doing is always defaulting to PIN it for later... Pinterest link and Pinterest Recipe Scraper
	- Distinguish between

Look at Examples to see how they do it:
	- Wikia Recipe Scraper https://github.com/bebraw/recipe-scraper
	- BBC Recipe Scraper https://github.com/tomdyson/BBC-Recipe-Web-Scraper
	- Python Recipe Scraper for various websites (Definitely looks like I can base off of this)
		https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scraper
	- BBC Recipe Scraper written in Go. I think I'll use this for the general format / organization of the algorithm because its written by a graduate student and has a lot of stars and Forks (Most stars for Recipe scraper on Github) https://github.com/sleepypikachu/still-good-food
